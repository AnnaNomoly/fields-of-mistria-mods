# Cookbook
A YYTK plugin for FieldsOfMistria that allows you to **learn any cooking recipe** in the game. This works on __existing__ saves!

## Instructions
1. Press `F10` to open the input dialog where you can specify one of the **recipe names** from the table below.

> **NOTE**: The recipe name must be formatted *exactly* as shown in the table below!

2. The mod will output some information to the YYTK console window. If the recipe was **INVALID** you will get a warning message. If the recipe is **ALREADY KNOWN** you will get a different warning message. If the recipe is **NEW** you will get a success message, learn the recipe, and additionally the "new recipe" window will appear in the game!

## Craftable vs Non-Craftable Food
From the perspective of this mod there are two "types" of cooked dishes in the game: **craftable** an **non-craftable**.
- **Craftable** dishes are food __with a recipe__. You normally use recipe scrolls to "learn" how to craft (cook) it. This mod allows you to unlock those recipes without needing to use the scroll.
- **Non-craftable** dishes are food that __has no recipe__. You normally receive it as a reward for doing something or buy it from a shop. This mod does NOT allow you to obtain those food items. Use the **DigUpAnything** mod to obtain them if desired.
> **REMINDER**: This mod only unlocks **craftable** food (those __with recipes__).
