## Rules of the Dungeon

### The Dungeon's Curse
All standard consumable **items**, **weapons**, and **armor** are *prohibited* in the Deep Dungeon. Only items *specific* to the Deep Dungeon, such as **Sigils**, **Salves**, and the **Mistpool** equipment are permitted. Additionally, all **mining** and **combat perks** as well as **infusions** are *disabled* in the Deep Dungeon, and **status effects** are *removed* when descending floors. Lastly, and most painful, the dungeon's **lift** is *disabled*.

### Salves

The *only* **healing items** allowed in the Deep Dungeon. The **health**, **stamina**, and **mana salves** may only be used *once* per floor and provide *immediate* recovery. A special salve, the **sustaining potion**, has *no restrictions* on its use and provides a one-hour *restoration* buff.

### Sigils

Powerful **items** found *only* in the Deep Dungeon. These *single use* scrolls are imbued with powerful **beneficial effects** that will help you survive!

### Floor Enchantments

Custom **special effects** for each floor that are *randomly* assigned. These offer a range of **beneficial** and **detrimental** effects that will make every descent into the dungeon unique!

### Offerings

Special **events** that allow you to *sacrifice* **health**, **stamina**, or **mana** before proceeding to the next floor. Doing so will grant an exceptionally powerful **beneficial** OR **detrimental** effect on the next floor.

### Floor Traps

Hidden **tiles** in the dungeon floor that activate by *proximity*. Each trap triggers a unique **detrimental** effect that will temporarily hinder your progress on the floor!

### Dread Beasts

Extremely dangerous **monsters** with significantly bolstered *stats* (**HP**, **Attack**, **Defense**) and unique *custom* **attack patterns**.

### Mistpool Equipment

The **mistpool armor**, **sword**, and **pickaxe** are the *only* basic equipment that function in the Deep Dungeon! Be sure to stop by the **Blacksmith's Shop** to purchase them *before* venturing into the dungeon!

### Keys

Single use **items** that allow you to descend *immediately* to the **seal room** associated with the key's **biome**. These are your primary method for *returning* to the deeper floors of the dungeon.

### Orbs

Special **items** that may be *crafted* using new **crafting materials** from each biome. These allow you to trigger a **boss fight** for a chance to obtain special **loot**!

### Cursed Gear

Cursed pieces of **equipment** that may *only* be used as a **crafting ingredient** to craft special **class armor**.

### Soul Stones

Strange *stones* said to contain the memories of a fallen adventurer. These rare **items** may *only* be used to *craft* special **class armor**.

### Class Armor

Rare and powerful **armor** that may *only* be *crafted* using *cursed gear*, **soul stones**, and other Deep Dungeon *materials*. These **armor sets** provide *unique* **set bonus** effects the *more* pieces you equip!


## Salves

These **healing items** are your primary means of *recovery* in the Deep Dungeon. Keep in mind that the **health**, **stamina**, and **mana salves** may *only* be used *once* per floor. You may *purchase* them at the **Clinic** without restrictions.

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1b35e92f-8d1d-48f7-8434-0447b82f7e4c

### Clods

Clod dread beasts will *randomly* select one of the *three* following **attack patterns** to continuously attack with: **Wall**, **Spin**, or **Split**. The **wall** pattern causes the clod to shoot a large line of 10 pellets repeatedly. The **spin** pattern causes the clod to spin while shooting pellets at varying angles repeatedly. The **split** pattern causes the clod to shoot a barrage of pellets that continuously split into more pellets.

### Saplings

Sapling dread beasts have the *combined properties* of all sapling variants in the game. They have significantly *increased* **jump** and **attack distances**, *drop* a **slowing puddle** when landing, and even *split* into *three* more **saplings** when defeated! The saplings they split into are the same variant as the dread beast.

### Shrooms

Shroom dread beasts have the *combined properties* of all shroom variants in the game. They have extremely *increased* **stealth** and **attack speeds**, and *drop* a **poison puddle** after attacking. Additionally, they will enter **stealth** *immediately* when the floor starts, and re-enter stealth if the player moves away without attacking.

### Enchanterns

Enchantern dread beasts have an extremely *increased* **dash distance** and the *balls of electricity* they drop **persist** for a significant amount of time.

### Stalagmites

Stalagmite dread beasts will *randomly* select one of the *two* following attack patterns to continuously attack with: **Circle** or **Cross**. Each pattern has *two* types of attacks the stalagmite will alternate between using. Additionally, the type of attack initially used is *randomly* selected depending on the pattern. The **circle** pattern causes the stalagmite to *alternate* between creating a large circle of spikes on top of itself and an enormous circle of spikes further away from itself. The **cross pattern** causes the stalagmite to *alternate* between creating a large cross of spikes on top of itself in either cardinal or inter-cardinal directions.

### Bats

Bat dread beasts have extremely *increased* **movement speed**, will more *aggressively* **follow and attack** the player, and *always* shoot *three* soundwaves with every attack.

### Lava Cats

Lava Cat dread beasts have an *enormous* **charge distance** and significantly *reduced* **idle time** between attacks. They are also *highly resistant* to **water** and will shrug off the petrification effect very quickly.

### Flame Spirits

Flame Spirit dread beasts have significantly *increased* **teleportation speed** and the *balls of fire* they shoot **persist** for a significant amount of time, allowing up to *two* fireballs to seek the player simultaneously.
###

You will *always* be notified if a **dread beast** is present on a dungeon floor at the *start* of a floor. Use that knowledge to prepare accordingly and survive.


## Mistpool Equipment

The **mistpool weapon**, **armor**, and **pickaxe** are the *only* standard equipment permitted in the Deep Dungeon. These pieces of equipment have a *unique effect* where they **increase in power** the *deeper* in the dungeon you are. To explain further, the **mistpool sword's** *attack value* will **increase** the *higher* the floor number, and the same is true for the **mistpool armor's** *defense value*. The **mistpool pickaxe's** *damage* and *charge level* will also **increase** the *higher* the floor number.

Additionally, the **mistpool equipment** has *custom sprites* and *assets* that **glow brighter** as their **power increases**.

###
Make sure to *purchase* the **mistpool equipment** at the **Blacksmith's Shop** *before* entering the Deep Dungeon!


## Keys

Keys are *single use* **items** that may be used to *descend* to a **seal room** in the Deep Dungeon *from* the **mine's entrance**, effectively allowing you to circumvent the *locked* **lift**. Keys are *awarded* to you for reaching a **seal room** *without* the use of a key, and a separate key exists for each **biome** other than the Upper Mines. Additionally, all monsters have a very low *chance* of *dropping* a key when defeated.

![](https://i.imgur.com/Gz9KFAp.png)


## Orbs

Orbs are *single use* **items** that may be used to *initiate* a **boss battle** in the Deep Dungeon from the **mine's entrance**. Orbs may be *crafted* at any **kitchen** using unique *materials* gathered in the various **biomes** within the Deep Dungeon. A separate orb exists for each biome other than the Upper Mines.

# Cursed Gear

Cursed gear is *crafting* **material** found in the Deep Dungeon. It can *rarely* be found in **treasure chests** and is a *guaranteed* reward for reaching a **seal room** *without* the use of a **key**. Crafting **class gear** requires a piece of **cursed gear** *matching* the same equipment slot.

![](https://i.imgur.com/JJTXp6P.png)


## Soul Stones

Soul stones are another *crafting* **material** found in the Deep Dungeon. They can *sometimes* be obtained by *defeating* a **dread beast**, and are also a *guaranteed* reward for *completing* a **boss battle**. Soul stones are associated with a **class** and may only be used to craft the gear specific to that class. For example, the cleric soul stone may only be used for crafting cleric gear.

![](https://i.imgur.com/p5IP4eX.png)


## Class Armor

Class armor are *legendary* pieces of **equipment** that must be *crafted* using **materials** from the Deep Dungeon. This special **armor** provides *unique* **set bonuses** the *more* pieces from a *matching set* you equip simultaneously. Obtaining all of the **materials** to *craft* these powerful armor sets will require you to travel to deepest floors of the Deep Dungeon.

The *class armor* **recipes** will be *unlocked automatically* and are available in the **blacksmithing** *crafting* menu. Each piece of **armor** in the set will *require* crafting **materials** from a specific **biome** in the Deep Dungeon, in addition to a **soul stone**.

### Configuration File
> **Author's Note**: The **configuration file** will NOT exist until the game (and mod) have been *started at least once*. Therefore, if you wish to configure the mod, *start the game* until the **title screen loads**, then EXIT the game, and lastly edit the **configuration file** *before restarting* the game.

###
In order to **customize** the mod, you must *modify* the **properties** in its **configuration file**.

├─ mod_data
│  ├─ DeepDungeon
│  │  ├─ DeepDungeon.json
```

The full "path" to the file will *vary* depending on *where* the game is installed. For example, with the game installed via **Steam** on the **C drive** the full path for the configuration file would be:
```
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Fields of Mistria\mod_data\DeepDungeon\DeepDungeon.json
```

### Default Configuration

The configuration file by *default* will look like the following:
```json
